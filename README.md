# Horiseon Website 

## Description 

The marketing agency wanted their codebase to follow acessibility standards, and for the website to be optimized for search engines.

## Changes Made

- **Semantic HTML elements:** non-semantic elements within the code were changed to semantic elements. For example, div was changed header and section.
- **HTML structure:** the HTML elements follow a logical structure.
- **Image alt attributes:** descriptive alt attributes have been added to all images, making the webpage more accessible for people using assistive technology, eg screen readers.
- **Heading attributes:** fall in sequential order compared to the website content.
- **Title element:** now has a more desciptive title including the name of the agency and what the agency does, which optimizes the website for search engines. 
- **Link function:** the link for "Search Enging Optimisation" was not functioning properly, which has been fixed. 
- **CSS efficiency:** multiple CSS elements with the same function have been consolidated into singular elements. The CSS elements have also been organised to follow the structure of the HTML file.
